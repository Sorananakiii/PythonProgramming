# While statement

'''
Iteration : while function 

    We have one other major tool for controlling program flow, which is repetition.
    In programming, we will use repetitive loops to execute the same code many times

    1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False.
    2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
    3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.
